FOR LOOP
--------------

	Print the numbers 1 to 100, with each line containing a group of 5 numbers. For example:
	
		1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
		6, 7, 8, 9, 10
	
	Two for-loops, one for the rows and one for the columns, can handle this task.
	
		scala> for (i <- 1 to 100 by 5) {
		        for (j <- i to (i + 4)) 
		        	{ print(s"$j, ") }
		        println("")
		      }
		1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
		6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
		11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
